                    <h4>About Me</h4>
                    <span>
                        I am 24 years old this year and a Bachelor Degree graduate in Information Technology from RMIT Australia. 
                        I am a little quiet at first but am quickly able to adapt to my surroundings given the circumstances. 
                        Furthermore, I am able to work in a group with new people and communicate without any problem. 
                        I can speak multiple languages with English being my main language and most fluent.

                    <h4>Objective</h4>
                    <span>
                        I am a graduate of RMIT seeking a position that will allow me to use my knowledge of management and developing skills to contribute to a quality company. 
                        Moreover, I would like to work in a professional and active environment where I can apply what I was taught in University and previous workplaces to progress and develop within my job. 
                        In my previous jobs, I was put into teams of 4 and was able to freely communicate with my team members our differences and set a goal that all of us were set to achieve. 
                        I am able to work together and communicate in a group with different people and am also able to handle myself properly under pressure. 
                        Furthermore, I have submitted all of my work given on time. 
                        I am positive that I am able to do the same when given work.
